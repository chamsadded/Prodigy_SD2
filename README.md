# Prodigy_SD2
This program generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program prompts the user to input their guess, compares it to the generated number, and provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. It continues until the user correctly guesses the number and then displays the number of attempts it took to win the game.
